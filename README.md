# Getting Started
#### Installation
1) This plugin is built using Node and can be installed using: ```npm install mineflayer-plasmovoice --save```

#### Simple Sound Player
A bot that sneaks will play a certain sound (/path/to/music.mp3) and get up.
```js
const mineflayer = require("mineflayer")
const plasmo = require("mineflayer-plasmovoice")

const bot = mineflayer.createBot({
    "host": "localhost"
})

bot.loadPlugin(plasmo)

bot.on("plasmovoice_connected", () => {
    bot.setControlState("sneak", true)

    // Path to file with any audio format
    bot.plasmovoice.sendAudio("/path/to/music.mp3")
})

bot.on("plasmovoice_audio_end", () => {
    bot.setControlState("sneak", false)
})
```

#### Debugging
```js
const plasmo = require("mineflayer-plasmovoice")

/** By default - 4, and these are warnings, errors and fatal errors */
plasmo.setLoggingLevel(0)
```

#### Listening players
> An example of an event when some player is talking
- Data format is `pcm_s16le` (waveform)
- Sequence number goes in order from the number `1`, some packet **may be skipped** when using the UDP protocol
```js
bot.on("plasmovoice_voice", (data) => {
    /*{
        player: string,
        distance: number
        sequenceNumber: BigInt
        data: Buffer
    }*/
})
```

> An example of an event when some player stopped talking
```js
bot.on("plasmovoice_voice_end", (data) => {
    /*{
        player: string,
        sequenceNumber: BigInt
    }*/
})
```
